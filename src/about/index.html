      We are currently running our courses out of the GriffinCamp a leading startup accelerator in downtown Montreal's innovation district.
      Our goal is to bring coding literacy to as many people as possible. We believe that with the right environment, best teachers,
      and partnerships with the right companies, we can fuel local, national, and international organizations with a new
      wave of talented developers.
