        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>The following policy outlines how 9320-7223 Québec inc. (the “Company”) will collect, use, protect and
            disclose personal information. Please note that this policy also applies to Internet and e-mail use by the
            Company’s employees, contractors, clients, customers and suppliers.</p>

        <h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>Personal information is any information which can identify an individual or through which an individual’s
            identity can be deduced, and which is disclosed to us or which we create within the context of our
            relationship with the individual. Please note that Personal information does not include information
            which does not relate to an identified individual nor does it include an individual’s name, title, business
            address or business telephone number (i.e. “business card information”).</p>
        <p>The Company’s privacy policy is based on the Canadian Standards Association’s Model Code for the Protection
            of Personal Information.</p>

        <h2>Why Does the Company Collect Personal information?</h2>
        <p>In serving the needs of the Company and its employees, contractors and customers, it is important that the
            Company have accurate information. The Company may collect personal information in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>establish your identity</li>
            <li>understand your needs for, and determine your suitability for, products and services</li>
            <li>provide services to you and process payments for your account</li>
            <li>inform you of new products and services</li>
            <li>establish and maintain an employment or contractor relationship</li>
            <li>adhere to legal requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Will Personal Information Be Used?</h2>
        <p>The Company may use personal information in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>administer and maintain the employment relationship</li>
            <li>administer and maintain benefits</li>
            <li>comply with legal, regulatory and other obligations</li>
            <li>carry out our business operations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Might Personal Information Be Disclosed?</h2>
        <p>The Company may disclose personal information in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>administer and maintain the employment/contractor relationship</li>
            <li>administer and maintain benefits and payroll</li>
            <li>make hiring decisions</li>
            <li>submit quotes or proposals to prospective customers or clients</li>
            <li>enable employees/contractors to access client/customer facilities or that of the Company (ie. security clearances)</li>
            <li>explore and/or undertake corporate opportunities, including a merger, acquisition, amalgamation, IPO, reorganization or sale of the Company, including the due diligence process and the transfer of information through to closing of any such transaction</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Does the Company Collect Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>
            We collect your personal information at the time you become a new customer, client, supplier, employee or
            contractor of the Company and thereafter when we communicate with you.  For example, we collect your
            personal information through:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>our sales and supply agreements with you</li>
            <li>your discussions with our employees and contractors</li>
            <li>your visits to our website and/or intranet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Employees/contractors are responsible for ensuring that changes to their personal information
            (i.e. address, telephone number, social insurance number, banking information for the purpose of direct
            deposit, etc.) are communicated to us.</p>

        <h2>How Does the Company Protect Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>Safeguards, security systems and processes are in place to protect your
            information against unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification, whether on-site or off-site.</p>
        <p>Human resource files as well as information regarding payroll and benefits
            coverage is accessible to those Company individuals who have been designated with such authority and
            only to the extent necessary to accomplish the objectives we’ve described above, or to the Company’s
            relevant benefits and/or payroll providers.  All personal employee/contractor information maintained
            within the Company is centrally located and is maintained secure and confidential.  All personal
            information provided to the Company’s benefits and/or payroll providers is disclosed only upon assurances
            that those providers maintain similar standards of personal information protection.</p>

        <h2>How Long Will the Company Retain Your Information?</h2>
        <p>We retain your information for only so long as is necessary for the purposes
            for which it has been collected.  Your personal information will be destroyed once it is no longer needed
            by us and once all requirements at law have been met.</p>

        <h2>Have You Consented?</h2>
        <p>There are some instances where we may need to disclose personal information
            to a third party service provider.  Whenever we engage a third party service provider, we confirm that its
            privacy and security standards meet our requirements.  In the event that a third party service provider is
            located outside of Canada, the government, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that
            jurisdiction may be able to obtain disclosure of your personal information through the laws of that
            jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>By submitting your personal information to us, you have consented to our use
            and disclosure of the personal information for the purposes as outlined in this policy.  If we wish to
            use or disclose your personal information other than as described in this policy, we will obtain your
            express consent before doing so.</p>
        <p>If you prefer that we not use or disclose your personal information for any
            of these purposes, you may notify us in writing at any time.  If you do not notify us, we will consider
            you to have consented to our continued use and disclosure of your personal information.  A notification
            that we not use or disclose your personal information for certain purposes may affect our ability to
            provide you with products and/or services.</p>
        <p>Please note that from time to time, we may be compelled to release personal
            information as required or permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>How Can You Access Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>Your personal information, hard copy or electronic, is accessible to you.
            However please note that if your information is combined with information of others
            (such as payroll spreadsheets), you will not be granted access to such information unless we are
            able to segment your personal information.  If your request for personal information entails a significant
            cost due to time, resources or copying, there may be a charge.</p>

        <h2>Our Website</h2>
        <p>Each time you visit our website, we gather the date, time, browser type,
            name of visitor’s internet service provider, the site that referred the visitor to us, any pages that
            are requested, the navigation history and IP address of the visitor.  The foregoing information does
            not generally contain anything that can identify users personally.  We use this information for our
            internal audit log and system administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our
            user base.  This information may be shared with third parties in order to provide services for aggregate
            use.</p>
        <p>If you object to this gathering of information, you should not use or access our web pages.</p>
        <p>Our website may employ the use of “cookies”.  A “cookie” is a small line of data
            that is sent to your Internet browner from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
            Cookies can track how and when you use a site.  A cookie does not damage your system and identifies
            your browser, not you personally.  If you do not wish to receive a cookie, use the options in your web
            browser. </p>

        <h2>Who Should You Contact If You Have Questions or Concerns About This Policy?</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, or should you wish to
            review your personal information, please contact 9320-7223 Québec inc. at <a href="mailto:hello@decodemtl.com">hello@decodemtl.com</a></p>
